4. Build production ready: `npm run build`

## Project Structure
You can replace / change under `src` directory
1. `src/assets` : put all your assets including images, sounds, fonts, etc
2. `src/scss` : Styling start from here, look at `src/scss/main.scss`
3. `src/js` : Put all your js files here. Look at `index.html` file for the example. If you run `npm run build`, it will generated one minified & obfuscated js file magically!
4. `index.html` : your start point
